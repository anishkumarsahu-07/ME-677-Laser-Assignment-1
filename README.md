# ME-677-Laser-Assignment-1

### Problem

- Choose any material (metal) with well know thermal properties.
- For a pulsed laser of choose any value of laser fluence between $1-10^{4}~J/m^{2},$  pulse duration in the range of 1-1000 ns.
- For the material chosen, get the value of absorption coefficient and reflectivity using Fresnel equations.
- Solve the temperature along the depth of the material if the laser is irradiated on the top surface using finite difference method (FDM). See slides 6-9 of the lecture notes.
- Assume the laser intensity to be uniform along the beam cross-section and the pulse to be a step-function.
- Evaluate the power of the laser. Use this as the surface heat flux, assuming a unit cross-sectional area.
- Now using the closed-form solution to the surface heat flux problem, evaluate the temperature profile along the depth over time. See slides 10-14 of the lecture notes.
- Compare the temperature values obtained from both the methods. Justify if the results are different.
